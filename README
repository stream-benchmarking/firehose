This is the FireHose suite of stream processing benchmarks.

FireHose is meant to invoke the imagery of drinking from a firehose of
streaming data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of the FireHose Streaming Benchmarks is to enable
comparison of streaming software and hardware, both *quantitatively*
vis-a-vis the rate at which they can process data, and *qualitatively*
by judging the effort involved to implement and run the benchmarks.

The benchmarks themsleves each have a generator and analytic.  Code
for the generators is provided and is meant to be run as-is.
Reference implementations for the analytics are also provided; users
are free to re-implement them for other streaming frameworks or to
optimize them for their hardware.

The originators of FireHose are Karl Anderson and Steve Plimpton, who
can be contacted at keander@sandia.gov and sjplimp@sandia.gov.  The
FireHose WWW Site at http://firehose.sandia.gov (when it is put
on-line) has more information as well as tabulated performance
results.
