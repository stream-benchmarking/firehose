FireHose Streaming Benchmarks :c,h2

<H1></H1>

:c,image(images/firehose.jpg)

These web pages describe a collection of open-source stream processing
benchmarks we have defined, called FireHose.  We are inviting users
and authors of various stream-processing frameworks to implement and
experiment with the benchmarks in order to refine/expand their
definitions and collect performance results.  After this initial
phase, we plan to create a new FireHose web site, which will include
the definition of the benchmarks, sample software implementations, and
performance results.  We hope the benchmarks and the WWW site will
stimulate further discussion and interactions within the streaming
community.

The sponsors of the FireHose benchmarks are Karl Anderson (DoD) and
"Steve Plimpton"_http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp (Sandia National
Labs).
