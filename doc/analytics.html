<H3>Analytics 
</H3>
<P>The current version of FireHose has three analytics:
</P>
<OL><LI><A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly1</A> = anomaly detection in a fixed key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly2">anomaly2</A> = anomaly detection in an unbounded key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly3">anomaly3</A> = anomaly detection in a two-level key space 
</OL>
<P>Source code for these is in the tarball directory "analytics".  Each
sub-directory has code for multiple versions of the analytic,
developed in different languages and for different streaming
frameworks.  Instructions for how to build and run the analytics is
given in the <A HREF = "run.html">Running the benchmarks</A> section.
</P>
<P>These are the implementations we currently provide.  Over time, as
users contribute them, we hope to add more implementations of the
analytics, written for various streaming frameworks.
</P>
<UL><LI>C++: This is a reference implementation which runs on a single core.
It can be examined to learn details of how the analytic is defined and
can be implemented efficiently.  Typically it is a single file. 

<LI>Python: This is also a reference implementation which runs on a single
core.  It is typically more concise than its C++ counterpart, but will
not run as efficiently.  

<LI>PHISH: These are implementions in C++ and/or Python which run on top
of the <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/phish.html">PHISH library</A>.  PHISH is a lightweight, open-source
framework for processing streaming data with distributed-memory
parallelism.  It passes datums between processes running on one or
more cores via message-passing, using either the <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</A>
(message-passing) or <A HREF = "http://www.zeromq.org">ZMQ</A> (sockets) library as a back-end.  The
processes are stand-alone programs (C, C++, Python, etc) which, in
this case, contain code similar to what is found in the serial
implementations of the analytic. 
</UL>






<P>As explained below, each analytic is required to perform a specific
computation on the streaming data it receives via a UDP port from one
of the stream generators described in the <A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A>
section.  The format of the stream is defined by the generator.
</P>
<P>An implementation of the analytic should follow the rules discussed
below.  Most importantly, it should be robust to the possibility it
will miss packets in the stream which arrive before the analytic is
ready to read them.  This is because the generators can be run at high
rates, which may outpace the analytic.
</P>
<P>If you wish to implement an analytic yourself, or to run a benchmark
on your hardware, you are free to implement it in a different manner
from the provided code.  But you need to perform the computations
outlined below and adhere to the following guidelines, at least if you
wish to contribute your implementation to the code archive and your
performance results to the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section.
</P>
<UL><LI>The analytic should not archive (e.g. to disk) the entire stream or
large portions thereof and perform its computation when the stream
ends.  This violates the spirit of a streaming benchmark and would not
work in practice when the stream is infinite. 

<LI>As described in the <A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A> section, when running
in parallel to achieve higher stream rates, each instance of a
generator will emit keys that do not overlap with the keys of the
other generators.  This is to make it easier to check for correct
answers and score the results.  However, the analytic cannot take
advantage of this fact.  It must assume that a datum (and its key)
could have come from any of the generators.  Thus it is not
permissible, for example, to process a stream coming from N generators
as N independent streams being read by N copies of an analytic
program, each processing its own unique set of keys. 

<LI>Each analytic takes a single argument which is the UDP port ID to read
the stream from.  Each analytic may also define optional command-line
switches, useful either to pass in stream parameters, or for
debugging.  The options for the serial implementations are listed
below.  Versions written for different frameworks may define different
optional arguments.  Check the README files in the implementation
sub-directories for details. 

<LI>While an analytic is running, it should print results to the screen as
it finds them, i.e. in real-time as it identifies anomalies.  This
needs to be in the format described below so that the results can be
checked against the correct answer, for scoring purposes.  See the
<A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section for details. 

<LI>The analytic must implement logic for detecting when the stream ends.
As described in the <A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A> section, this is done
by checking for specially-formatted STOP packets.  If a single
generator is sending to an analytic, this is a simple check.  The
logic is more convoluted if multiple generators are sending data to
the analytic.  See the reference implementations for an example of how
this can be handled. 

<LI>When the analytic terminates, it should print final statistics on the
number of packets it received, as well as summaries of its
computations, as discussed below.  These are useful for debugging and
are used in the scoring metrics.  Some of the summary values also
appear in the tables of the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section. 
</UL>
<P>Any additional anayltic-specific rules are discussed below.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "anomaly1"></A>(1) Anomaly detection in a fixed key range 
</H4>
<P>This analytic is designed as a simple test of anomaly detection; keys
are flagged as unbiased or biased (anomalous) depending on the values
associated with an individual key as it appears multiple times.  Only
a small fraction of the keys are biased.
</P>
<P>It is designed for use with the <A HREF = "generators.html#bias">biased-powerlaw
generator</A>, which produces packets of datums,
each of which is an ASCII text string in the following format:
</P>
<PRE>1000582694,0,1 
</PRE>
<P>The first field is a "key", which can be represented internally as a
64-bit unsigned integer.  The second field is a "value" of 0 or 1.
The third field is a "truth" flag, also 0 or 1.
</P>
<P>The computational task for this analytic is to identify biased keys.
An unbiased key will have 0 versus 1 values appear with equal
probability.  A biased key will have 0 versus 1 values appear in a
skewed 15:1 probability ratio.
</P>
<P>Detection can be performed by keeping track of the values seen for
each key, e.g. in a hash table of fixed size (see below).  When an
individual key has been seen 24 times, the key is labeled "biased" if
a value of 1 appeared 4 or less times; otherwise the key is labeled
"unbiased".  When the decision is made, the answer is checked against
the "truth" flag appended to each datum.  The large majority of the
results will be keys correctly flagged as unbiased (true
negative). The other 3 cases are more rare; the count for each of the
4 categories is tallied by the analytic:
</P>
<UL><LI>true anomalies = keys correctly flagged as biased
<LI>false positives = keys incorrectly flagged as biased
<LI>false negatives = keys incorrectly flagged as unbiased
<LI>true negatives = keys correctly flagged as unbiased 
</UL>
<P>The analytic also emits a line of output when a detection event in one
of the first 3 categories occurs, in this format, where the last field
is the key:
</P>
<PRE>true anomaly = 12345
false positive = 34567
false negative = 67890 
</PRE>
<P>Note that due to statistical variation in the way the generator
produces random values, for the 3 rare outcomes, true anomalies should
mostly be detected, but about 20% of the rare cases will be false
positives, with an occasional false negative as well.
</P>
<P>The analytic also keeps track of the following statistics which are
printed in the following format at the end of the benchmark:
</P>
<PRE>packets received = 999986 
datums received = 49999300 
unique keys = 85578 
max occurrence of any key = 16709489 
true anomalies = 34
false positives = 6
false negatives = 0 
true negatives = 3220 
</PRE>
<P>A reasonable way to implement this analytic is with a hash table that
stores a running tally of the values seen for each unique key.  Note
that the analytic does not know how many times an individual key will
appear in the stream, though it need not retain a key after it has
been seen 24 times.
</P>
<P>Optional command-line switches in the serial reference implementations
(C++ and Python):
</P>
<UL><LI>-b = bundling factor = # of datums in one packet, default = 50
<LI>-t = check key for bias when appears this many times, default = 24
<LI>-m = key is biased if value=1 <= this many times, default = 4
<LI>-p = # of generators sending to me, only used to count STOP packets, default = 1
<LI>-c = 1 to print stats on packets received from each sender, default = 0 
</UL>
<P>Additional implementation rules:
</P>
<UL><LI>The <A HREF = "generators.html#bias">biased-powerlaw generator</A> is hard-wired to
produce at most 100,000 unique keys per instance of the generator.  It
is OK for the analytic to know and use this value, e.g. to
pre-allocate memory for a hash table of fixed size.  Note that for
good performance this size should typically be a multiple of the
number of generators contributing to the stream (see the -p switch),
since the keys each generator emits do not overlap. 

<LI>The truth flag cannot be used, except to check answers. 
</UL>
<HR>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "anomaly2"></A>(2) Anomaly detection in an unbounded key range 
</H4>
<P>This analytic is also designed as a simple test of anomaly detection;
keys are flagged as unbiased or biased depending on the values
associated with an individual key as it appears multiple times.
However the number of unique keys in the stream is effectively
infinite for long benchmark runs, so the analytic must decide which
keys to store state for.
</P>
<P>It is designed for use with the <A HREF = "generators.html#active">active set
generator</A>, which samples from an unbounded
range of keys.
</P>
<P>In benchmark runs using this analytic, huge numbers of unique keys
will be generated, which means it will be inefficient to use a hash
table to store all of them, unless some provision for expiring keys is
implemented (see below).
</P>
<P>Aside from this change in the distribution of keys in the data stream,
the computational task of detecting biased keys is identical to the
decscription for <A HREF = "#anomaly1">analytic #1</A>, as is the format of output
the analytic should generate.  The only exception is that a final
output for "max occurrence of any key" is no longer a relevant value
to tally.
</P>
<P>A reasonable way to implement this analytic is with an expiring hash
table that attempts to keep track of values for keys in the active set
of the generator, e.g. via a least-recently used (LRU) metric, where
the key selected for expiration (removal from the hash table) is the
one seen longest ago in the stream.  As discussed below, the size of
the set of active keys is limited by the generator which can be used
by the analytic to age keys efficiently.  Note however that the
analytic does not knowhow many times an individual key will remain in
the generator's active set or appear in the stream, though it need not
retain a key after it has been seen 24 times.
</P>
<P>Optional command-line switches in the serial reference implementations
(C++ and Python):
</P>
<UL><LI>-b = bundling factor = # of datums in one packet, default = 50
<LI>-t = check key for bias when appears this many times, default = 24
<LI>-m = key is biased if value=1 <= this many times, default = 4
<LI>-p = # of generators sending to me, only used to count STOP packets, default = 1
<LI>-c = 1 to print stats on packets received from each sender, default = 0
<LI>-a = size of active key set, default = 131072 (128K) 
</UL>
<P>Additional implementation rules:
</P>
<UL><LI>The <A HREF = "generators.html#active">active-set generator</A> is hard-wired to use
an active set size of 131072 (128K) keys.  It is OK for the analytic
to know and use this value (see the -a switch above), e.g. to setup an
expiring hash table that keeps only the most recently seen N keys.
Since the analytic does not know which keys the generator keeps in its
active set, N should be larger than the active set size, so that it is
unlikely to expire a key that the generator still treats as active.  A
good value for N is 2x the active set size.  Note that the size of the
active set seen by the analytic is effectively a multiple of the
number of generators contributing to the stream (see the -p switch),
since the keys each generator emits do not overlap. 

<LI>The truth flag cannot be used, except to check answers. 
</UL>
<HR>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "anomaly3"></A>(3) Anomaly detection in a two-level key space 
</H4>
<P>This analytic also performs anomaly detection; a set of keys are
flagged as unbiased or biased depending on the values associated with
an individual key as it appears multiple times.  However, the
key/value pairs for which the bias detection is done, are derived from
state information that must be stored for a different set of keys,
namely those which appear in the data stream.  This requires two
iterations of storage and lookup in different hash tables.
</P>
<P>It is designed for use with the <A HREF = "generators.html#twolevel">two-level
generator</A>, which produces packets of datums,
each of which is an ASCII text string in the following format:
</P>
<PRE>3929309884956,57364,1 
</PRE>
<P>As explained on the doc page for the <A HREF = "generators.html#twolevel">two-level
generator</A>, the first field is an "outer" key
(64-bit unsigned integer), the second field (16-bit unsigned integer)
is a portion of an "inner" key, and the the third field is a "counter"
for how many times the outer key has been emitted.
</P>
<P>The first 4 times the outer key is seen, the analytic should store the
4 values.  The fifth time the outer key is seen, the 4 previous values
are concatenated (right to left, i.e. low-order to high-order) into a
new "inner" key, which also becomes a 64-bit unsigned integer.  The
value for the inner key is the rightmost digit of the value for the
fifth occurrence of the outer key, which is a 0 or 1.
</P>
<P>The inner key/value pairs are treated the same as the key/value pairs
in the <A HREF = "#anomaly1">first analytic</A> and checked for bias.  I.e. when an
individual inner key has been seen 24 times, the inner key is labeled
"biased" if a value of 1 appeared 4 or less times; otherwise the inner
key is labeled "unbiased".  When the decision is made, the answer is
checked against the "truth" flag, which was the leftmost digit in the
value of the fifth occurrence of any of the outer keys which generated
this inner key.
</P>
<P>The four categories (true anomalies, false positives, false negatives,
true negatives) of inner keys, and the format of output the analytic
should generate, is the same as described above for the <A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly1
analytic</A>.  As in the second analytic, the only exception is
the final output of "max occurrence of any key" is no longer a
relevant value to tally.
</P>
<P>Note that if packets are dropped, the analytic should not try to
construct inner keys from incomplete information.  The third counter
field in the outer key datum can be monitored to insure a specific
outer key is seen all 5 times it is needed.
</P>
<P>A reasonable way to implement this analytic is with two expiring hash
tables, one for outer keys and another for inner keys, and to expire
keys from each via a least-recently used (LRU) strategy, as explained
for the <A HREF = "#analytic2">anomaly2 analytic</A>.  Outer keys will be emitted at
most 5 times (but may be emitted less); individual inner keys will be
encoded in the stream an unknown number of times.
</P>
<P>Optional command-line switches in the serial reference implementations
(C++ and Python):
</P>
<UL><LI>-b = bundling factor = # of datums in one packet, default = 50
<LI>-t = check key for bias when appears this many times, default = 24
<LI>-m = key is biased if value=1 <= this many times, default = 4
<LI>-p = # of generators sending to me, only used to count STOP packets, default = 1
<LI>-c = 1 to print stats on packets received from each sender, default = 0
<LI>-a = size of active key set, default = 131072 (128K) 
</UL>
<P>Additional implementation rules:
</P>
<UL><LI>The <A HREF = "generators.html#active">two-level generator</A> is hard-wired to use
active set sizes of 131072 (128K) keys for both the outer keys it
generates explicitly and the inner keys it generates implicitly.  It
is OK for the analytic to know and use this value (see the -a switch
above), e.g. to setup expiring hash tables that keep only the most
recently seen N keys.  Since the analytic has no way of knowing which
keys the generator keeps in its active sets, N should be larger than
the active set size, so that it is unlikely to expire a key that the
generator still treats as active.  For both hash tables, a good value
for N is 2x the active set size.  Note that the size of the active set
seen by the analytic is effectively a multiple of the number of
generators contributing to the stream (see the -p switch), since the
keys each generator emits do not overlap. 

<LI>The truth flag cannot be used, except to check answers.
