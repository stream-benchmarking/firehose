<H3>Running the benchmarks 
</H3>
<P>The current version of FireHose defines three benchmarks:
</P>
<OL><LI><A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly1</A> = anomaly detection in a fixed key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly2">anomaly2</A> = anomaly detection in an unbounded key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly3">anomaly3</A> = anomaly detection in a two-level key space 
</OL>
<P>Each benchmark uses a specific stream <A HREF = "generator.html">generator</A> and a
specific <A HREF = "analytics.html">analytic</A>, as discussed below.  Multiple
copies of a generator may be run to create higher-bandwidth streams,
writing either to a single or multiple UDP ports.  An implementation
of the analytic can be run in serial or parallel (shared or
distributed memory), so it may also choose to read from multiple UDP
ports.
</P>
<P>Currently, we advise running both the generator(s) and the analytic on
a single (multicore) box.  This will test performance of the analytic
without bottlenecks associated with network bandwidths or latencies.
However, the generators and analytics can be run on different boxes
(across a network) which has the advantage that the box running the
analytic will devote no CPU cycles to generating the stream.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: A single FireHose generator running on a single core,
may generate as much as 50 Mbytes of data per second.  Since the UDP
protocol means no receiver is throttling the sender, injecting the
stream as UDP packets into a network can quickly saturate available
bandwidth and have a negative impact on network performance,
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "build"></A>Building the generators and analytics 
</H4>
<P>Each of the <A HREF = "generators.html">generators</A> can be built from the
appropriate directory as follows:
</P>
<PRE>% cd generators/powerlaw
% make 
</PRE>
<P>The generator makefiles use gcc as the compiler.  You can edit the
makefiles to use another compiler or if some setting needs to be
changed for your machine.
</P>
<P>The serial C++ versions of the <A HREF = "analytics.html">analytics</A> can be built
from the appropriate directory as follows:
</P>
<PRE>% cd analytics/anomaly1/c++
% make 
</PRE>
<P>The serial Python versions of the analytics do not need to be built.
</P>
<P>Other implementations of the analytics may need to be built in
different manners.  See the README in the sub-directory for those
implementations for details.
</P>
<P>For example the PHISH implementation requires you have the <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/phish.html">PHISH
Library</A> installed on your box as well as either an MPI or ZMQ
library that PHISH uses.  Once PHISH is installed, e.g. with the MPI
back-end, you can type
</P>
<PRE>% cd analytics/anomaly1/phish
% make linux.mpi 
</PRE>
<P>to build the PHISH "minnows" that are invoked when a PHISH input
script is launched.
</P>


<P>The analytic makefiles (for c++ and PHISH) use g++ as the compiler.
You can edit the makefiles to use another compiler or if some setting
needs to be changed for your machine.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "testgen"></A>Testing the generators 
</H4>
<P>You can test any of the generators, without running an analytic, as
follows.  In one window, type
</P>
<PRE>% nc -l -u 55555 
</PRE>
<P>Then in another window, type the following (for the powerlaw
generator):
</P>
<PRE>% cd generators/powerlaw
% powerlaw 127.0.0.1 
</PRE>
<P>This should trigger a rapid output of packets and their datums in the
first window.  If you let the generator run long enough, it will print
a summary message like the following, when it is finished generating
all its packets:
</P>
<PRE>packets emitted = 1000000
datums emitted = 50000000
elapsed time (secs) = 15.6978
generation rate (datums/sec) = 3.18516e+06 
</PRE>
<P>Neither the generator or the "nc" command will exit.  Kill both of
them with a Ctrl-C.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "testanalytic"></A>Testing the analytics 
</H4>
<P>You can only test one of the anayltics by running it in tandem with
the corresponding generator.  The steps for doing this are as follows:
</P>
<OL><LI>launch the analytic in one window
<LI>launch the generator in another window
<LI>kill the generator after the stream is complete and the analytic exits 
</OL>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The order of these steps is important.  You must
launch the analytic before launching the generator, else the analytic
will miss initial packets.
</P>
<P>You can launch the C++ version of an analytic by typing the following
(for the anomaly1 analytic):
</P>
<PRE>% cd analytics/anomaly1/c++
% anomaly1 55555 
</PRE>
<P>You can launch the Python version by typing the following (for the
anomaly1 analytic):
</P>
<PRE>% cd analytics/anomaly1/python
% python anomaly1.py 55555 
</PRE>
<P>Instructions on how to launch other versions are given in the README
in the sub-directory for those implementations.
</P>
<P>The powerlaw generator is the one to use with the anomaly1 analytic.
It can be launched in another window as described above:
</P>
<PRE>% cd generators/powerlaw
% powerlaw 127.0.0.1 
</PRE>
<P>As soon as you do this, the <A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly1</A> analytic should begin
to find anomalies and print information to the screen.  This should
continue until the generator has emitted all its packets, which is 1
million (or 50 million datums) by default.  (You can change this with
a "-n N" switch on the powerlaw command if you wish.)  This should
take 15 to 30 seconds on a typical machine.
</P>
<P>When the generator is finished it will print a summary of its
generation statistics to the screen.  The analytic should do likewise
and should exit.  The generator will not exit, so you need to kill it
with a CTRL-C.
</P>
<P>Note that not all of the analytics produce output as immediately as
<A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly1</A>.  For example, there is a delay of a few seconds
for <A HREF = "#anomaly3">anomaly3</A> to begin finding anomalies, due to its
processing two levels of keys.
</P>
<P>If your run does not drop packets, any version (C++, Python, etc) of
each of the analytics should produce results identical to those in the
results directory of the FireHose tarball.  Those were run using a
single generator for varying numbers of packets from 10,000 to 10
million.  As discussed in the <A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A> section,
you can set the number of packets via a "-n N" switch for any of the
generators.
</P>
<P>You can check if the analytic processed all the packets in the stream
by comparing the "packets emitted" value printed by the generator to
the "packets received" value printed by the analytic.  If your run
drops packets, you will likely get different output when comparing to
the files included in the results directory.  You can dial down the
generation rate using a "-r N" swtich on any of the generators, which
should eventually reduce the drop rate to 0.0.  See the
<A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A> section for details.
</P>
<P>You can increase the stream rate by running multiple generators.
The easiest way to do this is by running one from each of multiple
windows.  E.g. to run with two generators, launch the analytic
as follows:
</P>
<PRE>% cd analytics/anomaly1/c++
% anomaly1 -p 2 55555 
</PRE>
<P>And then launch the generators in each of two windows:
</P>
<PRE>% cd generators/powerlaw
% powerlaw -p 2 -x 0 127.0.0.1 
</PRE>
<PRE>% cd generators/powerlaw
% powerlaw -p 2 -x 1 127.0.0.1 
</PRE>
<P>The meaning of the -p and -x switches is discussed in the
<A HREF = "generators.html">Generators</A> and <A HREF = "generators.html">Analytics</A> sections.
</P>
<P>If you launch both generators at (nearly) the same time, they will
also finish at the same time, and the analytic will see a data stream
arriving at (nearly) 2x the rate of a single generator.  Again the
analytic should exit when both generators have finished, and you will
then need to kill both the generators with CTRL-C.
</P>
<P>You will quickly find that launching and killing generators and
analytics in different windows is tedious work.  See the sub-section
below about the <A HREF = "#launch">launch.py</A> script in the tools directory,
which automates this procedure.

<H4><A NAME = "tuning"></A>Tuning your machine 
</H4>
<P>The default settings within the kernel of most Linux installations are
not ideal for sending and receiving UDP packets at high streaming
rates with minimal packet loss.  The default buffer sizes are too
small to prevent loss of data when there are "hiccups" in the system
due to OS operations, e.g. swapping and switching between processes.
</P>
<P>You can query the current settings for both send ("s") and receive
("r") buffers by the following commands:
</P>
<P>% cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
% cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default
% cat /proc/sys/net/core/smem_max
% cat /proc/sys/net/core/smem_default
</P>
<P>If they are only a few 100 Kbytes, you should set them to values more
like 16 Mbytes, via these commands:
</P>
<P>% sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max='16777216'
% sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default='16777216'
% sysctl -w net.core.smem_max='16777216'
% sysctl -w net.core.smem_default='16777216'
</P>
<P>You will need sudo or root privileges to make these changes.  You
should write down the original values if you wish to restore them
after running FireHose benchmarks.
</P>
<P>These buffer sizes assume you have adequate memory on your box that
reserving 32 Mbytes for UDP send and receive buffers is not a problem.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "bench1"></A>Benchmark #1 - anomaly detection in a fixed key range 
</H4>
<P>This benchmark uses the <A HREF = "generators.html#bias">biased-powerlaw
generator</A> and the
<A HREF = "analytic.html#anomaly1">anomaly1</A> analytic.
</P>
<P>While it is running, this analytic should print information about
anomalies it finds to the screen, one line at a time, flagging the key
value as either a "true anomaly", "false positive", or "false
negative".  The meaning of these various flavors of anomalies is
discussed on the <A HREF = "analytics.html#anomaly1">anomaly1 analytic</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>At the end of the run, the analytic prints a summary like this:
</P>
<PRE>packets received = 1000000
datums received = 50000000
unique keys = 85567
max occurrence of any key = 16713641
true anomalies = 34
false positives = 9
false negatives = 0
true negatives = 9645 
</PRE>
<P>If no packets were dropped, these are exactly the results you should
see if a single copy of the generator produces 1 million packets (the
default), i.e. 50M datums.  See other files in the results directory
for output from runs with fewer or more generated packets.
</P>
<P>The number of unique keys (85K in this case) is out of the 100,000
keys the <A HREF = "generators.html#bias">powerlaw generator</A> samples from.  See
its doc page for details.
</P>
<P>To produce an entry for the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section, this
benchmark needs to be run for 5 minutes, ideally with no dropped
packets.  The generation rate and number of packets necessary to do
this will depend on which implementation of the analytic you use, and
what machine you run it on.  See the discussion below about the
<A HREF = "#launch">launch.py</A> script which can help automate such a run.

and the <A HREF = "analytic.html#anomaly2">anomaly2</A> analytic.
</P>
<P>While it is running, this analytic should print information about
anomalies it finds to the screen, one line at a time, flagging the key
value as either a "true anomaly", "false positive", or "false

</P>
<P>At the end of the run, the analytic prints a summary like this:
</P>
<PRE>packets received = 1000000
datums received = 50000000
unique keys = 34885815
true anomalies = 395

see if a single copy of the generator produces 1 million packets (the
default), i.e. 50M datums.  See other files in the results directory
for output from runs with fewer or more generated packets.
</P>
<P>Note that the number of unique keys, as well as the number of
anomalies found is much higher than for the anomaly1 benchmark.  This
is because the <A HREF = "generators.html#active">active set generator</A> samples
from an unbounded range of keys.  See its doc page for details.
</P>
<P>To produce an entry for the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section, this
benchmark needs to be run for 30 minutes, ideally with no dropped
packets.  This is so that the expiration strategy for the hash table
of the analytic is stress-tested.  The generation rate and number of
packets necessary to do this will depend on which implementation of
the analytic you use, and what machine you run it on.  See the

and the <A HREF = "analytic.html#anomaly3">anomaly3</A> analytic.
</P>
<P>While it is running, this analytic should print information about
anomalies it finds to the screen, one line at a time, flagging the key
value as either a "true anomaly", "false positive", or "false
negative".  The meaning of these various flavors of anomalies is the
same as for the anomaly1 benchmark except that they apply not to keys
in the data stream, but to "inner" keys derived from their values, as
discussed on the <A HREF = "analytics.html#anomaly3">anomaly3 analytic</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>At the end of the run, the analytic prints a summary like this:
</P>
<PRE>packets received = 1000000

<P>If no packets were dropped, these are exactly the results you should
see if a single copy of the generator produces 1 million packets (the
default), i.e. 40M datums.  See other files in the results directory
for output from runs with fewer or more generated packets.
</P>
<P>Note that statistics are given for both "outer" keys (in the data
stream) and "inner" keys (derived from the values of outer keys).  As
with the anomaly2 benchmark, both of these kinds of keys are sampled
from unbounded ranges.
</P>
<P>To produce an entry for the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section, this
benchmark needs to be run for 30 minutes, ideally with no dropped
packets.  This is so that the expiration strategy for the hash tables
of the analytic are stress-tested.  The generation rate and number of
packets necessary to do this will depend on which implementation of
the analytic you use, and what machine you run it on.  See the
discussion below about the <A HREF = "#launch">launch.py</A> script which can help
automate such a run.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "launch"></A>Using the launch.py script to run benchmarks 
</H4>
<P>The tools directory of the FireHose distribution has Python and shell
scripts which are useful when running benchmarks or when running the
generators and analytics on their own.
</P>
<P>The launch.py script can be used for the following tasks:
</P>
<UL><LI>Run a benchmark, with one or more generators and an analytic together,
for a specified time or at a desired rate. 

<LI>Run a benchmark interatively at slower rates until the drop rate is
acceptable, then perform a benchmark run. 

<LI>Run one or more instances of a generator with various command-line
options. 

<LI>Run an analytic with various command-line options, including analytics
like PHISH versions that require specialized launch commands or
post-processing of results to format them for scoring. 

<LI>Perform a benchmark run (possibly with dropped packets), then perform
a second benchmark run (at a slower rate, or with the C++ reference
implementaion) with no drops. 

<LI>Compute a "score" between two runs: one with dropped packets and one
without. 
</UL>
<P>The most convenient attribute of launch.py is that it manages all the
"processes" that are part of a benchmark run, namely one or more
generator proceses and an analytic process.  It launches them in the
correct sequence, monitors and collects their output, and cleans up
after they have finished, killing them as needed.  A summary of the
run is printed to the screen and a log file for later review.
</P>
<P>As a simple example, the following command could be used to run the
C++ version of the first benchmark at a stream rate of 5.6M datums per
second (which requires 2 generators) for 5 minutes, to generate the
results needed for an entry in the table of the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A>
section.
</P>
<PRE>python launch.py bench -bname 1 -gnum 2 -grate 5600000 -gtime 5 -adir c++ -id bench1.c++ 
</PRE>
<P>The output from the various processes are written to these files:
</P>
<UL><LI>generator.bench1.c++.0 = output from 1st generator
<LI>generator.bench1.c++.1 = output from 2nd generator
<LI>analytic.bench1.c++ = output from analytic (list of found anomalies)
<LI>log.bench1.c++ = summary of run, including drop rate 
</UL>
<P>A single launch.py command can also be used to perform a benchmark run
followed by a 2nd no-drop run and "score" the results of the 1st
against the 2nd, to compare the accuracy.  The scoring metrics are
explained in the <A HREF = "results.html">Results</A> section.
</P>
<P>Examples of using the launch.py script to perform multiple, successive
benchmark runs for various tasks, are illustrated in the bench.py
script, also included in the tools directory.  For example, if you
know Python, it is easy to write a loop in bench.py to loop over a
series of short runs, each invoked with launch.py, that generate
datums at different stream rates, to quickly estimate a maximum stream
rate that can be processed without dropped packets.
</P>
<P>The full documentation for launch.py and its options is listed at the
top of the launch.py file, and included here.  In brief, there is one
required argument which is the "action" to perform, which is one of
the following:
</P>
<PRE># gen = run the generator only
# analytic = run the analytic only
# bench = run a benchmark with generator and analytic together
# score = score a pair of already created output files
# bench/score = perform 2 benchmark runs and score them
#   1st run with specified settings
#   2nd run with -adrop 0.0 
</PRE>
<P>Then there are optional switches for the generator (all of which have
defaults):
</P>
<PRE># -gname powerlaw/active/... = which generator to run (def = powerlaw)
# -gcount N = total # of packets for all generators to emit (def = 1000000)
# -grate max/N = aggregate rate (datums/sec) for all generators (def = max)
# -gnum N = # of generators to run (def = 1)
# -gtime N = minutes to run all generators (def = 0)
#   if non-zero, overrides -gcount
#   iterates over short test runs to reset -gcount
# -gtimelimit N = time limit in short iterative -gtime runs (def = 10.0)
# -gswitch N string = command-line switches for Nth generator launch
#     (def = "" for all N)
#   N = 1 to gnum
#   enclose string in quotes if needed so is a single arg
#   note: these switches are added to ones controlled by other options
#   note: -r, -p, -x are controlled by other options
#   note: can be specified multiple times for different N
# -gargs N string = arguments for Nth generator launch (def = "" for all N)
#   N = 1 to gnum
#   enclose string in quotes if needed so is a single arg
#   note: default of "" means 127.0.0.1 (localhost) will be used
#   note: can be specified multiple times for different N 
</PRE>
<P>and likewise for the analytic:
</P>
<PRE># -aname anomaly1/anomaly2/... = which analytic to run (def = anomaly1)
# -adir c++/python/phish/... = which flavor of analytic to run (def = c++)
# -adrop any/N = target drop rate percentage for analytic (def = any)
#   if not any, overrides -grate setting
#   iterates over short test runs to reset -grate
# -adropcount N = use for -gcount in short iterative -adrop runs (def = 1000000)
# -afrac fraction = drop -grate computed by -adrop by this fraction
#                   to insure no drops, only used if -adrop 0.0 (def = 1.0)
# -acmd string = string for launching analytic (def = "")
#   enclose string in quotes if needed so is a single arg
#   not needed for -adir c++/python
#     unless you need to change command line settings
#   required for other -adir settings
#     e.g. this script doesn't know how to launch a PHISH job
#   note: script will cd to -adir setting before cmd is invoked
# -apost string = command to invoke to post-process analytic output into
#                 expected format, e.g. to merge multiple output files,
#                 launch.py treats stdout of invoked string as file content
#                 note: will invoke command from within -adir directory 
</PRE>
<P>Finally, there are a few generic optional switches that can be
specified:
</P>
<PRE># -id string = string to append to all output file names (def = "launch")
# -bname N = which benchmark to run (def = 0)
#   if non-zero, overrides -gname and -aname
# -table no/yes = if scoring, also output table format (def = no)
# -fdir path = FireHose directory (def = ~/firehose) 
</PRE>
<P>If you don't want to use the "launch.py" tool, the simpler "launch.sh"
script can be edited to launch multiple versions of a generator
(nearly) simultaneously.  It is written for use with the "tcsh" shell,
but similar scripts could be created for "bash" or other shells.
E.g. you can run it by typing
</P>
<PRE>% tcsh launch.sh 
</PRE>
<P>Note that the script launches the generators in the background.  You
should see output from all instances of the generator in the window
you run the script from.  After they complete, you MUST be sure to
explicitly kill each of the generator processes, else they may
continue to run, unnoticed in the background.  See the next section
for further discussion.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "kill"></A>Killing instances of running generators 
</H4>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because a generator process does not terminate until
explictly killed, it is possible for one or more instances of running
generator to persist after a benchmark run completes.  Because a
running generator continues to send its STOP packets in an infinite
loop, it will continue to consume system resources and may confuse an
analytic the next time the analytic is launched (e.g. it immediately
terminates without processing new packets).
</P>
<P>An unkilled generator can results from several scenarios:
</P>
<UL><LI>a benchmark run crashes
<LI>you kill the benchmark run before it ends
<LI>the launch.sh script is used to launch generator(s) in the background
<LI>the launch.py or bench.py scripts encounter some error condition 
</UL>
<P>The best way to insure no generators are currently running
are to type commands like this:
</P>
<P>% ps -ef | grep powerlaw
% ps -ef | grep active
% ps -ef | grep twolevel
</P>
<P>to identify their process IDs.
</P>
<P>Then a kill command such as this:
</P>
<PRE>% kill 93985 
</PRE>
<P>can be invoked on the ID to explicitly kill a running generator.
</P>
