<H3>Results 
</H3>
<P>There are FireHose benchmark results for the currently defined
benchmarks:
</P>
<OL><LI><A HREF = "#anomaly1">anomaly #1</A> = anomaly detection in a fixed key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly2">anomaly #2</A> = anomaly detection in an unbounded key range
<LI><A HREF = "#anomaly3">anomaly #3</A> = anomaly detection in a two-level key space 
</OL>
<P>They were run as described in the <A HREF = "run.html">Running the benchmarks</A>
section, on these <A HREF = "#machines">Machines</A>.
</P>
<P>For each benchmark a table is shown below with the following columns
of information:
</P>
<UL><LI>Version = which version of the analytic was run
<LI>Machine = what machine the benchmark was run on 
<LI>Ngen = # of generators used
<LI>Ndata = # of datums generated
<LI>Grate = aggregate stream rate for all generators, in datums/sec
<LI>Cores = # of cores the analytic was run on
<LI>Packets = percentage of packets or datums processed, 100.0 = no drops
<LI>Events = total events for the analytic to detect
<LI>Score = score for the analytic calculation, 0 = perfect (see discussion below)
<LI>Instant = no/yes for whether the analytic produces its answers instantly when a datum triggers a result, or whether there is some delay in the algorithm it uses
<LI>LOC = lines-of-code required to implement the analytic
<LI>Comments = footnotes to additional comments 
</UL>
<P>Some implementations of the analytic will have multiple entries,
e.g. if they were run on different machines, at different stream
rates, or in parallel on different numbers of processors.
</P>
<P>The "Packets" entry is the percentage of emitted packets that were
received and processed by the analytic.  Thus a value of 99.99% means
that 1 in 10,000 packets was dropped.  Ditto for datums since each
packet contains a fixed number of datums.
</P>
<P>The "Events" entry is a count of possible "events" within the stream
for the analytic to find.  Note that this is a function of how much
data is generated during the benchmark run.  Since each run is for the
same length of time, runs at a faster stream rate will generate more
datums and have a higher event count.  Each benchmark defines what it
counts as an "event".
</P>
<P>For the "Score" entry, the value is meant to measure deviations from
the correct result, either due to dropped packets, or invalid
computations by the analytic.  A low score is good and a high score is
bad.
</P>
<P>The score is computed by comparing the results from the benchmark run
in the table to results from a run by the C++ reference implementation
which is run so that it sees the identical stream from the
generator(s) at a rate slow enough to insure no packets are dropped.
The latter is considered the correct result.
</P>
<P>Each benchmark defines how it computes a score, as discussed below.
Typically one point is assigned for missed or mistaken events, so the
maximum score is roughly that of the event count.  But it's possible
for the score to exceed the event count, e.g. finding no actual events
and many incorrect events.
</P>
<P>If the benchmark run completed with no dropped packets, it should
receive a score of 0 if the analytic performed its computations
correctly.  The score will typically increase as more and more packets
are dropped.  How sensitive the score is to dropped packets depends on
the benchmark.
</P>
<P>There are at least 2 reasons why a no-drop run could result in a small
non-zero score.  First, when multiple generators are used, packets
arrive at the analytic in an indeterminate order.  This can alter the
events detected by the analytic.  Second, for benchmarks which use
expiring hash tables to track keys, there can be small differences
between the keys the generator keeps in its active set (and thus may
emit) versus keys the analytic deems to be active.  If the generator
emits a key the analytic has already discarded, this can lead to a
difference in a event counts (versus what the generator counts as
events).  Ditto if comparing two runs where the order of packets may
vary between them due to using multiple generators.  If the guidelines
discussed in the <A HREF = "analytics.html">Analytics</A> section are followed for
expiring hash tables, these differences should be minimal.
</P>
<P>The "LOC" is a lines-of-code count for the files in the analytics
sub-directories, including comments and blank lines.  For frameworks
like PHISH, only lines in scripts or code added to the framework to
run the benchmark are counted; lines in the framework code itself are
not included.
</P>
<P>In all the cases currently listed in the tables below, we attempted to
run the benchmarks at the maximum stream rate a particular version of
the analytic could process the stream and still maintain a (nearly)
zero drop rate.

<P>The event entry is the sum of true anomalies, false positives, false
negatives, and true negatives found in the correct result.
</P>
<P>One score point is tallied for each key in each true anomaly, false
positive, or false negative output of the correct result but which is
not in the benchmark result.  Likewise one point is tallied for keys
in those 3 categories in the benchmark result but which are not in the
correct result.  Individual keys which true negatives are not included
in the results (there are a lot of them), but the total key counts
are.  The absolute value of the difference between the true negative
totals in the 2 runs is also added to the score.
</P>
<P>Comments:
</P>
<P>(a) A 2-process PHISH run on top of MPI, using the in.anomaly
script.  One process reads packets, the other performs the anomaly
detection.  PHISH runs as a distributed-memory parallel program.
</P>
<P>(b) A 7-process PHISH run on top of MPI, using the in.parallel script.
One minnow (process) reads packets, 4 minnows re-bundle them by
hashing the keys, and 2 minnows perform the analytic computation, each
on a subset of the key space.  PHISH runs as a distributed-memory
parallel program.

<P>The event and score entries are computed in the same manner as for
benchmark #1.
</P>
<P>The events detected by this benchmark, and thus the score, are quite
sensitive to dropped packets, since a missed packet means an instance
of an "inner" key cannot be constructed, even if other packets
contributing to that key are received.  Thus a low drop rate can still
induce a poor score.
